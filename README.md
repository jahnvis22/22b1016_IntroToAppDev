# flutter_app2

Week 4 assignment
In lib folder, main.dart and loginscreen.dart file is there.
The three features I have added are:
1) Slidable delete
2) switch option to choose Income and expense in the add expense pop up screen and maintaining income and expenses total separately in the top bar of expense screen along with total
3) Allowing users to choose dates on which the particular income/expense occurred and sending it to the database
